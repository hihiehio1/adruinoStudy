What is this file?

If you are running PicPick on Windows Vista or 7, PicPick configurations are saved in
"C:\Users\[User name]\AppData\Roaming\PicPick\picpick.ini".

However, if you want to make PicPick a portable-software,  simply delete the "saveappdata.ini" file! 
Then all settings are saved in PicPick folder.

(If Windows UAC is turned on, please check PicPick is running in "C:\Programs Files\" without  "saveappdata.ini".)
